        <h2>For Alumni</h2>
        
        Your gift of a bicycle will support the expansion of a highly visible and popular program. Donations go directly to the maintenance and operations of
        bicycles, making an immediate impact on campus. Your generosity will enable us to offer a sustainable form of transportation to more Cornellians. As
        a token of appreciation, a message of your choice will be displayed prominently on the sponsored bike.
        
        <h2>For Local Businesses</h2>
        
        For the price of a bicycle, your local business can reach over 1800 Cornell students, faculty, and staff. Depending on the size of the sponsorship,
        your business will be recognized as a community partner in monthly newsletters, campus flyers, high visibility events, or on the sponsored bicycle.
