        Big Red Bikes is the student-run bike share service at Cornell. Students working in Big Red Bikes have the unique chance to impact Cornell's campus
        as part of an innovative business practicing social entrepreneurship. Our staff is made up of students studying Business, Engineering, Urban Planning
        and much more. This interdisciplinary team works with the campus administration and student groups to serve nearly 3000 members of the Cornell
        community while constantly expanding and improving our services. Recently we have expanded, doubling the number of bikes in our fleet and opening two
        new stations at Mann Library and Appel. We aim to continue this trend of innovation and entrepreneurship this semester through our projects:
