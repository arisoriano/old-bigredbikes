        <h2>What is Bike Sharing?</h2>
        Bike sharing is a growing industry across the world where users can check out a bike from one station in the system and return it to any other
        station. Bike share stations and their bikes are already a part of the urban landscape in European cities like Paris and Barcelona and recently they
        have arrived in North America. In the past few years,  bike sharing systems have been spreading rapidly in cities like New York City, Boston and
        Washington D.C. In May 2011 there were around 375 programs made up of 236,000 bikes. As of April 2013, there were around 535
        bike-sharing programs around the world, comprised of a convoy of approximately 517,000 bicycles--an almost doubling of forces in 2 years!
        <br/><br/>
        We are proud to be at the forefront of this innovative movement as one of the few universities in the world with a bike-sharing program. <a href=
        'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bicycle_sharing_systems#Universities' class='page_links' target='_blank'>Here</a> is a list of universities
        that have a bike-sharing program implemented on campus.
